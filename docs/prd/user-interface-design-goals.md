# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The application's user experience should be engaging, intuitive, and rewarding. The primary goal is to transform the passive lottery experience into an active and fun journey. The UI should feel clean, modern, and visually appealing, making complex features like cryptocurrency and NFTs feel simple and accessible to a broad audience.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

-   **Gamified Actions:** Core interactions like playing games, claiming daily rewards, and completing challenges should be accompanied by satisfying animations and sound effects to create a sense of progression and reward.
-   **Rich Collectible Experience:** The NFT gallery must be more than a simple grid. It should be a rich, interactive space where users can inspect their NFTs, view their properties and rarity, and have an option to set a "featured" NFT on their profile. The experience should make the collectibles feel valuable and desirable.
-   **Transparent Data Visualization:** The prediction engine must present historical data in a way that is visually engaging and easy to understand. Crucially, the UI must include clear, in-context explanations of what the data represents and explicitly state that it is for entertainment and analytical purposes, not a guarantee of winning.

## Core Screens and Views

-   Login / Registration Screen
-   Main Dashboard (featuring the prediction engine and access to games)
-   In-App Game Screen(s)
-   Crypto Wallet Page
-   NFT Gallery
-   User Profile / Settings Page

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application should adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

## Branding

*Assumption:* No formal branding guide exists yet. The aesthetic should be modern, clean, and trustworthy, with a slightly futuristic or "tech" feel to appeal to the target audience. A formal color palette, typography, and logo will need to be developed.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a responsive web application, providing a seamless experience on modern desktop and mobile browsers.
