# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   Achieve 10,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) within 6 months of launch.
*   Establish a revenue stream through premium subscriptions or NFT marketplace fees by the end of the first year.
*   Become recognized as a leading innovator in the digital lottery space within 12 months.
*   Users are successful if they are logging in daily to play in-app games and earn crypto rewards.
*   Users are successful when they actively participate in the NFT ecosystem by collecting, buying, and selling dynamic NFTs.
*   Users are successful when they feel part of an active community, measured by their participation in social events like the "yearly prediction party."

## Background Context

Currently, the lottery experience is passive and solitary. Players buy a ticket and simply wait, with the entire experience hinging on near-impossible odds. This lack of engagement and community interaction makes the process feel unrewarding and often like a waste of money for the vast majority of participants.

Existing digital lottery tools are purely functional, typically limited to ticket scanning or basic number generation. They fail to provide any meaningful entertainment, sense of progression, or community connection, leaving a significant gap in the market for an experience that is inherently fun and rewarding.
