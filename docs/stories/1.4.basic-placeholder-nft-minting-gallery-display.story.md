## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights**: Story 1.3 established comprehensive game system with crypto earning, centralized auth token management, and build configuration. The crypto balance system, game completion tracking, and Zustand state management patterns are ready to support NFT minting thresholds. Security improvements include centralized `tokenService` for auth management. Build infrastructure is fully operational with Next.js, Chakra UI v2.8.2, and comprehensive testing setup.

**Data Models**:
- **NFT Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface NFT {
    id: string;
    ownerId: string;
    name: string;
    description?: string;
    imageUrl: string;
    rarity: string;
    mintDate: Date;
    dynamicProperties?: Record<string, any>; // Properties that can change
    isFeatured: boolean;
    baseValue: number; // Intrinsic value in custom cryptocurrency
  }
  ```
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#nft]

**Database Schema**:
- **NFTs Table Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE public.nfts (
      id text PRIMARY KEY, -- Blockchain token ID or unique identifier
      owner_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      name text NOT NULL,
      description text,
      image_url text NOT NULL,
      rarity text NOT NULL,
      mint_date timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
      dynamic_properties jsonb, -- JSONB for flexible dynamic properties
      is_featured boolean DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL,
      base_value numeric NOT NULL -- Intrinsic value in custom cryptocurrency
  );
  ```
  [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-nfts]

- **RLS Policies**: "Users can view their own NFTs" FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = owner_id); "Users can update their own NFTs (e.g., is_featured)" FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = owner_id). [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-nfts]

**API Specifications**:
- **NFT Service Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /nfts` (list user's NFTs)
  - `GET /nfts/{id}` (get NFT details)  
  - `POST /nfts/mint` (internal: mint a new NFT)
  - `PUT /nfts/{id}/feature` (set an NFT as featured)
  - `POST /nfts/{id}/update-dynamic-properties` (internal: update dynamic properties based on lottery results)
  [Source: architecture/components.md#nft-service]

**Component Specifications**:
- **NFT Service**: Manages NFT definitions, mints NFTs, assigns them to users, and handles dynamic property updates. Dependencies: Supabase PostgreSQL (for NFT data), Supabase Storage (for NFT images), External Lottery Results API (for dynamic updates). [Source: architecture/components.md#nft-service]
- **Frontend Component Organization**: `apps/web/src/features/nfts/components/` for NFT-specific components, `apps/web/src/components/domain/` for application-specific components. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- **Frontend State Management**: Zustand for global state management, create specific store for NFT collection state. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]
- **Frontend Routing**: Dashboard pages organized under `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/` with layout.tsx for authenticated users. Collection route with NFT gallery at `/collection/nfts/`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-organization]
- **Frontend Services Layer**: `features/nfts/services/nftService.ts` for NFT-specific API calls. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#api-client-setup]

**File Locations**:
- Backend NFT API routes: `apps/web/src/app/api/nfts/route.ts`, `apps/web/src/app/api/nfts/[nftId]/route.ts`, `apps/web/src/app/api/nfts/mint/route.ts`, `apps/web/src/app/api/nfts/[nftId]/feature/route.ts`

- **Authentication**: Protected routes via middleware.ts, requires authenticated session from Story 1.1. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#protected-route-pattern]
- **Security**: NFTs are user-specific data with RLS policies ensuring users can only view/update their own NFTs. [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-nfts]
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for NFT image assets and other user-generated content. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**NFT Design Considerations**:
- Start with simple NFT templates for placeholder functionality to focus on minting and gallery workflow
- Fixed minting thresholds (e.g., first game completion) to maintain predictable user progression
- Basic rarity system ("Common", "Rare", "Legendary") for future gamification
- Dynamic properties support via JSONB for future lottery-based updates
- Featured NFT functionality for user profile customization

**Integration with Existing Systems**:
- **Game Service Integration**: Update `gameService.completeGame()` to check NFT award thresholds and trigger minting
- **Crypto Balance Integration**: Use existing crypto balance tracking from Story 1.3 for threshold detection
- **Auth Token Integration**: Use centralized `tokenService` from Story 1.3 security improvements
- **State Management Integration**: Follow established Zustand patterns from Stories 1.2 and 1.3

**Project Structure Notes**:
- All file paths align with established Next.js App Router structure from previous stories
- Frontend features organized by domain (auth/, lottery/, games/, nfts/)
- Backend API routes follow RESTful patterns under `/api` directory
- Testing files follow established patterns from previous story implementations
- Build configuration and dependencies from Story 1.3 are ready for NFT features
