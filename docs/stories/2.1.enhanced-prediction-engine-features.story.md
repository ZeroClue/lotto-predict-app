## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights**: Story 1.4 established complete NFT minting and gallery system with exceptional quality (100% QA score). The crypto earning system, comprehensive game completion integration, and centralized auth token management via `tokenService` are ready to support enhanced prediction features. Build infrastructure is fully operational with Next.js, Chakra UI v2.8.2, and testing setup. Zustand state management patterns are established across lottery, games, and NFTs features.

**Data Models**:
- **LotteryDraw Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface LotteryDraw {
    id: string;
    lotteryName: string;
    drawDate: Date;
    winningNumbers: number[];
    bonusNumber?: number;
    jackpotAmount?: number;
    sourceUrl?: string;
  }
  ```
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#lotterydraw]

**Database Schema**:
- **Lottery Draws Table Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE public.lottery_draws (
      id text PRIMARY KEY, -- e.g., "Powerball-2025-08-27"
      lottery_name text NOT NULL,
      draw_date timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
      winning_numbers integer[] NOT NULL, -- Array of integers
      bonus_number integer,
      jackpot_amount numeric,
      source_url text
  );
  ```
  [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-lottery_draws]

- **Indexes**: `CREATE INDEX idx_lottery_draws_name_date ON public.lottery_draws (lottery_name, draw_date DESC);` for efficient querying by lottery and date. [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-lottery_draws]

**API Specifications**:
- **Lottery Data Service Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /lottery/draws` (list recent draws)
  - `GET /lottery/draws/{id}` (get specific draw details)
  - `GET /lottery/predictions` (provide number suggestions based on historical data)
  - `GET /lottery/analytics` (new: advanced analytics data with frequency analysis)
  [Source: architecture/components.md#lottery-data-service]

**Component Specifications**:
- **Lottery Data Service**: Fetches and stores historical lottery draw results from external APIs, and provides this data to the prediction engine. Dependencies: External Lottery Results API, Supabase PostgreSQL (for storing historical data). [Source: architecture/components.md#lottery-data-service]
- **Frontend Component Organization**: `apps/web/src/features/lottery/components/` for lottery-specific components, existing components include `EntertainmentDisclaimer.tsx`, `NumberSuggestions.tsx`, `RecentDraws.tsx`, `HistoricalChart.tsx`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- **Frontend State Management**: Zustand for global state management, existing lottery store patterns established in previous stories. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]
- **Frontend Routing**: Dashboard pages organized under `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/` with existing predictions page at `/predictions/`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-organization]

**File Locations**:
- Backend Lottery API routes: `apps/web/src/app/api/lottery/draws/route.ts`, `apps/web/src/app/api/lottery/predictions/route.ts`, `apps/web/src/app/api/lottery/analytics/route.ts` (new)
- Backend Lottery service: `apps/web/src/lib/services/lotteryAnalyticsService.ts` (new)
- Frontend Lottery predictions: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/predictions/page.tsx`, `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/predictions/advanced/page.tsx` (new)
- Frontend Lottery components: `apps/web/src/features/lottery/components/`
- Frontend Lottery services: `apps/web/src/features/lottery/services/lotteryService.ts`

**Testing Requirements**:
- **Unit Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library for component and service testing
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with Supertest
- **E2E Tests**: Use Playwright for end-to-end testing of full analytics and prediction journeys
- Test file locations follow pattern: `{component/service}.test.ts` adjacent to source files
- [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Technical Constraints**:
- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Next.js, Chakra UI, Zustand, PostgreSQL (Supabase). [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with existing `lottery_draws` table and efficient indexing for date/lottery queries. [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-lottery_draws]
- **Authentication**: Protected routes via middleware.ts, requires authenticated session from Story 1.1. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#protected-route-pattern]
- **Data Visualization**: Integration with appropriate charting library (Chart.js, Recharts, or D3.js) for interactive analytics. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Analytics Design Considerations**:
- Implement frequency analysis calculating appearance rates for each number over configurable time periods
- Hot/cold number classification based on frequency thresholds (configurable)
- Trend analysis using moving averages and statistical measures over historical draws
- Interactive filters for date ranges, lottery types, and analysis parameters
- Export functionality for analytics data in common formats (CSV, JSON)
- Maintain entertainment disclaimer prominence across all enhanced features
- Ensure accessibility standards compliance for interactive chart components

**Integration with Existing Systems**:
- **Lottery Service Integration**: Build upon existing `lotteryService.ts` patterns from Story 1.2
- **Auth Token Integration**: Use centralized `tokenService` from Story 1.3 security improvements
- **State Management Integration**: Follow established Zustand patterns from previous stories
- **Predictions Page Enhancement**: Extend existing `/predictions/` page functionality rather than replacing

**Project Structure Notes**:
- All file paths align with established Next.js App Router structure from previous stories
- Frontend features organized by domain following established patterns
- Backend API routes follow RESTful patterns under `/api` directory
- Testing files follow established patterns from previous story implementations
- Build configuration and dependencies from Story 1.3 are ready for enhanced analytics features
- Existing lottery components and services provide foundation for analytics enhancements

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is of high quality, with a well-organized structure that adheres to project standards. The developer correctly identified and documented a piece of technical debt regarding the trend analysis chart's functionality. The codebase is clean and the use of Zustand for state management is appropriate.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `apps/web/src/features/lottery/components/AnalyticsFilters.tsx`
  - **Change**: Modified the `handleSubmit` function to correctly construct a `dateRange` object with `Date` instances.
  - **Why**: The component was passing raw date strings to the `fetchAnalytics` function, which mismatches the `AnalyticsFilters` type definition in the analytics service, causing a potential runtime error.
  - **How**: Imported the `AnalyticsFilters` type and ensured the payload matches the expected structure, making the component robust and preventing bugs.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓] - E2E test mocking is acceptable for this stage, but a true end-to-end test should be considered for regression.
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Refactored `AnalyticsFilters.tsx` for correct date handling.
- [ ] **Technical Debt**: Enhance `TrendAnalysisChart.tsx` to allow users to select which number's trend to view, rather than defaulting to the first.
- [ ] **Testing**: Create a true end-to-end test for the analytics workflow that does not mock the API, ensuring full integration validation.

### Security Review
No security concerns were identified. The new API endpoints are implicitly protected by the existing Next.js middleware pattern for the `/api` directory.

### Performance Considerations
The analytics service performs several calculations. For very large datasets, this could be slow. Caching strategies for the analytics results could be considered in the future if performance becomes an issue.

### Files Modified During Review
- `apps/web/src/features/lottery/components/AnalyticsFilters.tsx`

### Gate Status
Gate: CONCERNS → `docs/qa/gates/2.1.enhanced-prediction-engine-features.yml`

### Recommended Status
[✓ Ready for Done] - The concerns identified are non-blocking and can be addressed as technical debt in future stories.

### Review Date: 2025-08-30 (Follow-up)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)
