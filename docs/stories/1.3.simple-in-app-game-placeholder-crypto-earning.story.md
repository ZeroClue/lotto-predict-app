# Story 1.3: Simple In-App Game & Placeholder Crypto Earning

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to play a simple in-app game and earn placeholder cryptocurrency,
**so that** I can experience the gamification loop.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can access and play a simple in-app game.
2. Upon completing the game, user is awarded a fixed amount of placeholder cryptocurrency.
3. User receives immediate, clear, and visually engaging confirmation of crypto earning (e.g., animation, sound effect, prominent display of earned amount).
4. Placeholder crypto balance is updated in the user's profile and immediately reflected in the UI.

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights**: Story 1.2 established comprehensive lottery prediction engine with database infrastructure, API routes, frontend components, state management, and testing patterns. The authentication and database foundation from Story 1.1 is also ready to support game features. Both stories used Zustand for state management, Chakra UI for components, and comprehensive testing with Jest and Playwright.

**Data Models**:
- **Game Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface Game {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description?: string;
    rewardAmount: number;
    nftAwardThreshold?: number; // e.g., complete 5 times for an NFT
    isActive: boolean;
    imageUrl?: string;
  }
  ```
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#game]

- **CryptoBalance Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface CryptoBalance {
    userId: string;
    balance: number;
    updatedAt: Date;
  }
  ```
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#cryptobalance]

**Database Schema**:
- **Games Table Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE public.games (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
      name text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
      description text,
      reward_amount numeric NOT NULL,
      nft_award_threshold integer, -- Nullable if game doesn't award NFT
      is_active boolean DEFAULT TRUE NOT NULL,
      image_url text
  );
  ```
  [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-games]

- **Crypto Balances Table Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE public.crypto_balances (
      user_id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      balance numeric DEFAULT 0.0 NOT NULL,
      updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
  );
  ```
  [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-crypto_balances]

**API Specifications**:
- **Games Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /games` (list all active games)
  - `GET /games/{id}` (get game details)  
  - `POST /games/{id}/complete` (record game completion and award crypto)
  [Source: architecture/components.md#game-service]

**Component Specifications**:
- **Game Service**: Manages game definitions, tracks user game activity, and awards cryptocurrency for game completion. Dependencies: Supabase PostgreSQL for game data and user game activity, CryptoBalance management. [Source: architecture/components.md#game-service]
- **Frontend Component Organization**: `apps/web/src/features/games/components/` for game-specific components, `apps/web/src/components/domain/` for application-specific components like GameBoard. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- **Frontend State Management**: Zustand for global state management, create specific stores for game state and crypto balance. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]
- **Frontend Routing**: Dashboard pages organized under `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/` with layout.tsx for authenticated users. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-organization]
- **Frontend Services Layer**: `features/games/services/gameService.ts` for game-specific API calls. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#api-client-setup]

**File Locations**:
- Backend games API routes: `apps/web/src/app/api/games/route.ts`, `apps/web/src/app/api/games/[gameId]/route.ts`, `apps/web/src/app/api/games/[gameId]/complete/route.ts`
- Backend game service: `apps/web/src/lib/services/gameService.ts`
- Backend repositories: `apps/web/src/lib/repositories/gameRepository.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/repositories/cryptoBalanceRepository.ts`
- Frontend games hub: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/games/page.tsx`
- Frontend individual game: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/games/[gameId]/page.tsx`
- Frontend game components: `apps/web/src/features/games/components/`
- Frontend game services: `apps/web/src/features/games/services/gameService.ts`
- Frontend stores: `apps/web/src/stores/gameStore.ts`, `apps/web/src/stores/cryptoStore.ts`

**Testing Requirements**:
- **Unit Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library for component and service testing
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with Supertest
- **E2E Tests**: Use Playwright for end-to-end testing of full game completion journeys
- Test file locations follow pattern: `{component/service}.test.ts` adjacent to source files
- [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Technical Constraints**:
- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Next.js, Chakra UI, Zustand, PostgreSQL (Supabase). [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Row Level Security enabled for user-specific data access. [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- **Authentication**: Protected routes via middleware.ts, requires authenticated session from Story 1.1. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#protected-route-pattern]
- **Security**: Games are public data accessible to all authenticated users. Crypto balances are user-specific with RLS policies: "Users can view their own crypto balance" FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id). [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-crypto_balances]

**Game Design Considerations**:
- Start with simple game mechanics (number guessing, matching, clicking) to focus on the crypto earning flow
- Fixed reward amounts per game completion to maintain predictable economics
- Consider future NFT award thresholds for completing games multiple times
- Visual feedback is critical for user engagement and reward confirmation

**Project Structure Notes**:
- All file paths align with established Next.js App Router structure from Stories 1.1 and 1.2
- Frontend features organized by domain (auth/, lottery/, games/, nfts/)
- Backend API routes follow RESTful patterns under `/api` directory
- Testing files follow established patterns from previous story implementations

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation** with comprehensive architecture following established patterns from previous stories. The game system demonstrates strong adherence to separation of concerns, proper error handling, and consistent code organization. All acceptance criteria are fully implemented with thorough testing coverage.

### Requirements Traceability Analysis

**Full AC Coverage Achieved:**
- **AC1 (Game Access & Play)**: ✓ Games hub page, individual game components, navigation integration
- **AC2 (Crypto Earning)**: ✓ GameService.completeGame(), database integration, reward calculation  
- **AC3 (Visual Feedback)**: ✓ CryptoReward component, animations, prominent display, loading states
- **AC4 (Balance Updates)**: ✓ Real-time UI updates, crypto store integration, header display

**Given-When-Then Test Mapping:**
- **Given** authenticated user **When** accesses games **Then** hub displays available games → E2E test:17-31
- **Given** user plays game successfully **When** claims reward **Then** crypto awarded and balance updated → E2E test:33-79  
- **Given** game completion **When** reward claimed **Then** visual feedback displayed → E2E test:115-150
