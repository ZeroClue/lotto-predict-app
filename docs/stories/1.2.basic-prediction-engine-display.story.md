## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights**: Story 1.1 established user authentication with Supabase Auth, user session management via Zustand stores, protected route middleware, and comprehensive testing patterns using Jest and React Testing Library. The authentication foundation is complete and ready to support prediction features.

**Data Models**:
- **LotteryDraw Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface LotteryDraw {
    id: string;
    lotteryName: string;
    drawDate: Date;
    winningNumbers: number[];
    bonusNumber?: number;
    jackpotAmount?: number;
    sourceUrl?: string;
  }
  ```
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md#lotterydraw]

- **LotteryDraw Table Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE public.lottery_draws (
      id text PRIMARY KEY, -- e.g., "Powerball-2025-08-27"
      lottery_name text NOT NULL,
      draw_date timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
      winning_numbers integer[] NOT NULL, -- Array of integers
      bonus_number integer,
      jackpot_amount numeric,
      source_url text
  );
  ```
  [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-lottery_draws]

**API Specifications**:
- **Lottery Draws Endpoint**: `GET /lottery/draws`
  - Purpose: List recent draws for historical data display
  - Response: Array of LotteryDraw objects ordered by draw_date DESC
  [Source: architecture/components.md#lottery-data-service]

- **Lottery Predictions Endpoint**: `GET /lottery/predictions`
  - Purpose: Provide number suggestions based on historical data analysis
  - Response: Object containing suggested numbers and frequency analysis
  [Source: architecture/components.md#lottery-data-service]

**Component Specifications**:
- **Lottery Data Service**: Fetches and stores historical lottery draw results, provides data to prediction engine. Key interfaces: `GET /lottery/draws` (list recent draws), `GET /lottery/predictions` (provide number suggestions based on historical data). [Source: architecture/components.md#lottery-data-service]
- **Frontend Component Organization**: `apps/web/src/features/lottery/components/` for lottery-specific components, `apps/web/src/components/domain/` for application-specific components like PredictionChart. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- **Frontend State Management**: Zustand for global state management, create specific store for prediction data. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]
- **Frontend Routing**: Dashboard pages organized under `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/` with layout.tsx for authenticated users. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-organization]
- **Frontend Services Layer**: `features/lottery/services/lotteryService.ts` for lottery-specific API calls. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#api-client-setup]

**File Locations**:
- Backend lottery draws API route: `apps/web/src/app/api/lottery/draws/route.ts`
- Backend predictions API route: `apps/web/src/app/api/lottery/predictions/route.ts`  
- Backend lottery service: `apps/web/src/lib/services/lotteryDataService.ts`
- Backend lottery repository: `apps/web/src/lib/repositories/lotteryRepository.ts`
- Frontend predictions page: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/predictions/page.tsx`
- Frontend prediction components: `apps/web/src/features/lottery/components/`
- Frontend lottery services: `apps/web/src/features/lottery/services/lotteryService.ts`
- Frontend prediction store: `apps/web/src/stores/predictionStore.ts`

**Testing Requirements**:
- **Unit Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library for component and service testing
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with Supertest
- **E2E Tests**: Use Playwright for end-to-end testing of full user journeys
- Test file locations follow pattern: `{component/service}.test.ts` adjacent to source files
- [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Technical Constraints**:
- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Next.js, Chakra UI, Zustand, PostgreSQL (Supabase). [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Row Level Security enabled for public lottery data access. [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-lottery_draws]
- **Authentication**: Protected routes via middleware.ts, requires authenticated session from Story 1.1. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#protected-route-pattern]
- **Security**: Lottery draws are public data, accessible to all authenticated users. RLS policy: "Anyone can view lottery draws" FOR SELECT USING (TRUE). [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#table-lottery_draws]

**External API Integration**:
- **Lottery Results API**: External API integration for fetching lottery data. Purpose: fetch historical and current lottery draws. Integration will be scheduled (daily updates). [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#lottery-results-api]
- For MVP: Use sample/mock data seeded in database, external API integration can be added later.

**Project Structure Notes**:
- All file paths align with established Next.js App Router structure from Story 1.1
- Frontend features organized by domain (auth/, lottery/, games/, nfts/)
- Backend API routes follow RESTful patterns under `/api` directory
- Testing files follow established patterns from Story 1.1 implementation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality with clean architecture patterns, proper separation of concerns, and comprehensive error handling. The codebase demonstrates strong TypeScript usage, effective state management, and follows established project patterns from Story 1.1.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/web/src/lib/services/lotteryDataService.ts
  - **Change**: Replaced magic numbers with named constants (PREDICTION_CONSTANTS)
  - **Why**: Improves maintainability and makes algorithm parameters explicit
  - **How**: Added const object with descriptive names for all magic values (3, 2, 6, 15, etc.)

- **File**: apps/web/src/lib/services/lotteryDataService.ts  
  - **Change**: Replaced improper shuffle with Fisher-Yates algorithm
  - **Why**: Math.random() sort is not truly random and has bias
  - **How**: Implemented proper Fisher-Yates shuffle for unbiased randomization

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All code follows TypeScript best practices and clean architecture
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper Next.js App Router structure with feature-based organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive coverage with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright
- All ACs Met: ✓ All four acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Replaced magic numbers with named constants (lotteryDataService.ts)
- [x] Implemented Fisher-Yates shuffle for proper randomization (lotteryDataService.ts)
- [x] Validated comprehensive test coverage across all layers
- [x] Verified proper error handling and state management
- [x] Confirmed entertainment disclaimer prominence and compliance

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Implementation properly handles public lottery data with appropriate access controls. No credentials or secrets exposed. Input validation implemented for API parameters.

### Performance Considerations

Algorithm efficiency is excellent with O(n log n) complexity for frequency analysis. Database queries use proper LIMIT clauses and indexing on draw_date. State management optimized with Zustand for minimal re-renders.

### Files Modified During Review

- apps/web/src/lib/services/lotteryDataService.ts (refactoring improvements)

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.2-basic-prediction-engine-display.yml
